# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset contains anonymized features from real transactions, and the goal is to build a classifier to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

## Key Features:
- Data preprocessing with pandas
- Data visualization to explore transaction patterns
- Machine learning with scikit-learn (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.
